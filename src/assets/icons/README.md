# About Icons

Game icons are not included. You can find most of them in [zviznemte/PikminBloomAssets](https://github.com/zviznemte/PikminBloomAssets)
The mapping between icons and attributes is done in `./src/assets/decors`.

- `map` folder contains the white icons used for the map markers
- `picture-book` folder contains the gold icons used for the decor selection
